---------------------------
Create your first site - no frameworks, just basic css and html. 
Learn how web pages are structured - and how to organize data in html. 


Take a look inside: 
[]site 
  -index.html
  -style.css
  []img


To run:
1. open in favorite editor
2. Got to any browser at http://localhost:8000/
3. Practice by making other small changes

Keep practicing! And [support me](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anyabear) with a :coffee:
